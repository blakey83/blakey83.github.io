<h2>Briggs Meys test</h2>

<br><br>
<p>My Briggs Meyers test results revealed that I’m an INTJ-A, an Assertive Architect. This means, for me,<br> 
that I can use rational thought and ingenuity to bring a project to fruition.</P>

<p>In a team environment, my abilities to build and solve problems would be an asset. I have a high work <br>
ethic, and believe in my abilities. However I’m not the most able to accommodate the feelings of others.</p>

<p>When forming a group to work on a project, I would certainly be a positive member of the group. However,<br> 
my limitations would mean that I would need someone who has a strong character with a lot of empathy to <br>
hold me to account when I’m dealing with other members of the team.</p>

<h2>Learning Styles Test</h2>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>I found a learning styles test online at <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org">http://www.educationplanner.org</a>.The results of the test say that<br>
 I’m a 50% tactile learner. To be honest, this surprised me, as I’ve always been able to decipher things<br> 
 through reading books, which has been especially helpful in my career as an Electronics Technician. However I do <br>
 believe this is helpful, as I can change how I process and learn information, and will incorporate some “doing”<br> 
 things to re-enforce my study</p>
 
 <p>What this will mean for my behaviour inside a team, it would mean that we would possibly need to have more meetings,<br>
but make them shorter. I also think that I would need to take on task that have more of a physical component, as I would<br>
be more successful at these tasks. I also believe that it would benefit me to hold more face to face meetings, than to<br> 
only have contact online</p>

<p>So in regards to forming a group, I think that it would be beneficial to find group members that are in my geographical<br> 
location. Although this may not be possible due to the fact that I am studying distance education. It was also be important<br> 
to find team members that compliment my learning styles. For example, if I was able to find someone to partner up with that<br> 
is more of a visual learner, then we could share the load in such a way, that the heavier reading could be done by them, <br>
and the more practical work could be done by myself.</p>

<h2>Productivity Test</h2>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>The third test that I found online was to assess my productivity, it was conducted at <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/08/assessment-how-productive-are-you">https://hbr.org/2018/08/assessment-how-productive-are-you</a>.<br> 
The results show that I am 95% productive. This is a good results, and I think it shows that my choices over the last number<br> 
of years have paid off, and I do feel more productive than I have in any other time in my life. However, there is always room <br>
for improvement. While answering the questions, I did consider more ways that I could improve my productivity</p>

<p>In a group environment, obviously, being a productive member is incredibly important. Being able to be relied on by my team<br>
mates is something that I would pride myself on. Hopefully this level of productivity is emulated by my team. I think that <br>
organizing communications, and setting task efficiently and productively would make success a lot easier.</p>

<p>When forming a team, I think it would be better to find people who are also organized and productive. I think trying to maintain<br> 
a high level of organization with someone who works in an ad-hoc manner would be frustrating, and would lead to friction within the group.</p>
