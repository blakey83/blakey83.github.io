<h1>Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The project I am proposing is called Git project plus. I was recently introduced to <br>
Git and git hub, and was impressed at how multiple developers were able to work on the <br>
same project at the same time. However I do believe that the application can be built upon, <br>
in the age of project optimization. This is not an idea to improve on, or modify git, or <br>
github, I think these applications are rock solid. </p>

<p>This goal of this project is to create an app that can be used on both your phone and <br>
laptop that all developers, managers and other stakeholders can use to manage projects. <br>
Git allows developers to work on a project simultaneously. However it does not guide developers <br>
on what has been done, and a great deal of communication is needed, especially on larger projects.<br> 
The aim of this app is to streamline that communication, store and organize information <br>
technology projects.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>In a recent poll of senior leadership, over 28% of projects have failed. 37% of failures where <br>
caused by poor communications, either overall (19%) or by failure of senior management to communicate <br>
down (18%) (2). The reason for developing this App is to improve those outcomes. The app will <br>
improve communications between developers, as well as track changes to work flow in real time.</p>

<p>It is envisaged that the app will be scalable, so large scale projects, those that have a number <br>
of smaller projects within a larger strategic initiative, can be tracked from top to bottom. As part <br>
of the scalability, it can also enhance the interoperability of teams across the project, where one<br> 
sub-project can communicate assign work and request information in a documented way. </p>

<p>9% of project failures are caused by insufficient funds (2). Although this is sometimes unavoidable,<br> 
I believe that better co-ordination and tracking of resource utilization can be incredibly important. <br>
This app can be used to track resource utilization and can track when working hours and materials are<br> 
being used, and can also be used for future budgeting. Better utilization equals lower costs and <br>
better outcomes.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The project is to develop a communication and productivity application that will be a companion to Git. <br>
The working title is Git project plus, which allows potential a clue into what the app is, namely a way<br> 
to enhance projects that use Git to allow developers to share development work. The plus, is because <br>
the app does a lot more than that! </p>

<p>The app would be available on phone (apple and android) as well as available on the internet. The app<br> 
would be connected to a central server, this would store all the users’ information. When a user starts <br>
up the app, they will be asked to log in (or create an account). After logging in, the user will be on <br>
their own personal landing screen. At this point the user will be able to see a menu, which includes<br> 
the following options:</p>
<ul text-align:"center">
<li>Start a new project</li>
<li>View work groups</li>
<li>Projects in progress</li>
<li>New work assigned</li>
<li>View messages</li>
<li>View Calendar</li>
</ul>
<p> To start a new project, select the new project option. This will then open a screen that allows users<br> 
to fill in details needed for the project to commence. These include:</P>

<ul>
<li>Project Name</li>
<li>Project Description</li>
<li>Work Groups Assigned</li>
<li>Developers Assigned</li>
<li>Pinned Projects</li>
<li>Stakeholders</li>
<li>Begin Project</li>
</ul>

<p>Workgroups are organisations that you are a member of. For example, if you work for Intel microchip development team, <br>
then they would have their own work group, who would have all the developers that work for that team assigned. It is also <br>
possible that a user will be assigned to multiple work groups at work, as in the example, the user who works in the Intel <br>
microchip development team, may also be a member of I7 division within that team, so the projects they are assigned may be <br>
more specific. Conversely, the same user may also be a part of much larger workgroups, such as Intel Australia, or Intel <br>
worldwide. </p>

<p>Once the work group has been assigned, a drop down menu of other developers from within the workgroup can be used by selecting <br>
the developer’s assigned tab. You can add developers to the project by selecting an empty blue dot next to their name, there is also<br> 
a search function at the top.</p>

<p>The next tab is an option to pin projects to this project. This option is so that you project can be placed either under or in<br> 
line with other existing project. For example you may want to start a project to create a command and control server, a project that <br>
is part of a larger automation project. At this point you can pin the automation project to your server project, so that developers on <br>
each project can have visibility for the other, and interoperable segments can work more closely. This can also be used for project<br> 
that are happening alongside your project, for our example here, another team may be developing a client control unit, and it would<br> 
make sense for your project to be pinned to that.</p>

<p>Finally, leadership and stakeholders can be added to the project. This will allow relevant stakeholders and managers visibility<br> 
on the project. Again a drop down menu of leaders will come down, and can be selected. For this you can also add email addresses,<br> 
as not all stake holders would be available through the app.</p>

<p>Once the all the fields have been filled in, then the begin project button can be selected. You will then be forwarded to the <br>
project home screen. On this screen you see a work flow screen. At first it will be empty, however there will be a line near the top <br>
of the screen. On the line there will be selectable options. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Job</li>
<li>View Team</li>
<li>View Calendar</li>
<li>View linked projects</li>
</ul>

<p>For a new job, select the add job menu. This will open up a box, and this is where you can add a new task to the project.<br> 
The top will show the title of the task. Under there will be a running dialogue box. After giving the task a title, you can then use<br> 
the dialogue box to put a description of the task, then breaking up the task and you can assign people to these comments. Using @ will <br>
allow you to start typing a name and options will come up from the people assigned to the project. </p>

<p>On the left will be the link to resources that will be needed for the task. There will be an add resources icon above, so <br>
you can select that, and add resources as required One of these will be the github link to the project files. Other things<br> 
that may be there include customer specifications, management expectations or other notifications to allow the developers<br> 
to succeed.</p>

<p>After each post on the dialogue box is complete, it will be published by hitting enter. After it is published, you can <br>
right click on the dialogue and a drop down menu will appear. <br>
The selections include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add person</li>
<li>Add date</li>
<li>Add time</li>
<li>Add resources</li>
</ul>

<p>By using these menus you can track the part of the task if required. For example if say a new html file is needed to be <br>
created for a web graphical user interface. You could create a task within the project titled “create Web GUI”. You could<br> 
then create a dialogue that says the web GUI needs to be created. Can @bob and @tim please take a look at this. This will <br>
automatically include them in this task, and they will be notified through the app. You could then use the drop down menu <br>
to add a due date, the amount of time you think it should take and any items they would need to be ordered (probably none in this case). <br>
Because you have already added Bob and Tim to the dialogue, they will automatically be included, and won’t need to be added. <br>
You could use the drop down menu to add a leader, and these would be notified.</p>

<p>After the dialogue has been published and the options added, the system will then notify the people added to the dialogue <br>
box, and it will be automatically added to their diary. They would then be able to view the task box and add comments of <br>
their own. This way users can keep a dialogue of what they are doing and keep track of their commitments.</p>

<h2>Tools and technology</h2>

<p>The technology required for this project already exist. Firstly we would need a server to host the information of all users.<br> 
This would be scalable, as the user base grows, then so will the size of the sever required.</p>

<p>This project would need to have a user end operation. For this there would need to be a HTML and Java script to enable the <br>
user to interact using a computer. As this app will also be available on mobile phones, the apps would need to be developed<br> 
with code like swift for IOS and Java for Android. There would also require a lot of back end development. The use of PHP code<br> 
to ensure that data can be stored and retrieved would be important.</p>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>

<p>I am a firm believer that if this App is successful, then it will definitely improve communications across development teams. <br>
I think that the having so many ways to communicate means that tracking that communication is more difficult. With this app communications <br>
are tracked, and resources can be tracked as well as time. Organisation levels will improve and project outcomes will be better.</p>
