<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

<p>My Interest in IT relates mostly to my Career. I’m a Truck specialist on an AHS upgrade project in the Pilbara region. <br>
My interest in IT also started through work. I began my Career doing an Electronics trade in the Navy. Back then the work was all<br> 
about hardware replacement, however as the fleet upgraded, our systems became IP network based, and were run through software, so I <br>
had to learn a lot about IT. After leaving Defence a couple of years ago I was lucky enough to gain employment in resources, have found <br>
that IT skills are in very high demand.</p>

<p>When I decided to go for the degree in IT, RMIT seemed like the smart choice. Unfortunately my work commitments stop me from attending<br> 
classes full time. However, since, almost every university these days offers distance education, it freed me up to choose whatever school <br>
in Australia I wanted. So I did some research, asked some of my smarter friends and the name that kept coming up in regards to technology <br>
courses was RMIT. So I enrolled in this unit.</p>
  
<p>On viewing the unit list for this degree, I think that it’s quite a broad education in IT. I think there’s going to be a strong focus on <br>
programming and coding in the first year, which I’m looking forward to. I think the nuts and bolts, ‘this does that’ base will serve me <br>
well towards the end, when dealing higher concepts. There won’t be a huge leap in logic for my brain when dealing with things like IT <br>
networking, Software engineering and Web Programming (1)</p>
