<p>My ideal job would be the Strategic Technology Lead, Operations Transformation from Woodside Energy Ltd advertised on Seek<br>
 on the 3rd of March 2021. This is a leadership position for Woodside, a well know offshore Oil and Gas. This position would <br>
 involve coordinating the company’s technology transformation program. There would be a need to manage a number of small teams <br>
 delivering individual projects for the overall technology strategy. There would also be a need of informing and managing <br>
 relevant stakeholders, as well as the management and quality assurance of technology vendors.</P>
 
 <p>This position appeals to me because I like interacting with people, especially about technology and business. It would be<br> 
 a challenging role, as you would be responsible for the output of a number of teams, as well as the individuals within those <br>
 teams. There would be pressure to ensure that teams perform to high standard. Also I enjoy technology projects, as there is a<br>
 lot of satisfaction in watching something that was once only an Idea, become a reality.</p>
 
 <p>For this job, you would need a degree in either computer science of Information Technology. The skill that would be required<br> 
 would include good people skills, high levels of IT skills and leadership skills. You would also need about 10 to 15 years’ <br>
 experience in the technology field. Part of this experience would be in a leadership role, as well experience with project delivery.<br>
 It would also be advantageous to hold a cloud computing certification, such Amazon Web services cloud computing certification.</p>
 
 <p>My career started in the Navy, and I did 13 years as a Communications Electronics Technician. 5 years of that was in a leadership <br>
 position. I gained a certificate IV in Communications electronics as well as a cert IV in leadership and management. Since I left the <br>
 Navy I have been working in the resources industry working with automation technology. At the moment I’m working as an automation <br>
 specialist on a project to automate all the haulage trucks at an Iron ore mine.</p>
 
 <p>So to get to my dream job, the obvious thing that I am going to need is a bachelor’s degree. But on top of that I am also going to<br> 
 need significant leadership experience in the technology field. I have already got some experience in leadership, although my current <br>
 role lacks that. However my current role is project experience, and the skill that I have learned in this project can definitely help <br>
 with this role. I believe that perhaps 5 years of post-graduate experience in a leadership role will be enough to secure a role such a this.</p>
